{"author_date": "2019-07-04 14:50:01+01:00", "msg": "Disable HiddenHttpMethodFilter by default\n\nHiddenHttpMethodFilter can be problematic as it causes early\nconsumption of a request body if the body may contain parameters. This\nhappens as the filter needs to read the parameters to see if an\n_method parameter is present. The filter is only beneficial for web\napplications that are the hidden HTTP method functionality but is\npotentially detriimental to all applications that are not. As such\nwe no longer believe that it should be enabled by default and users\nshould be required to opt in.\n\nCloses gh-16953"}
