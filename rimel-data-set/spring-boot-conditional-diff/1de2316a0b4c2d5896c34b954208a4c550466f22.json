As `LocalValidatorFactoryBean`\nexposes 3 contracts (JSR-303 `Validator` and `ValidatorFactory` as well as\nthe `Spring` validator one), this makes sure that those types can be\ninjected by type.\n\n`LocalValidatorFactoryBean` exposes 3 contracts and we're only checking\nfor the absence of a `javax.validation.Validator` to auto-configure a\n`LocalValidatorFactoryBean`. If no standard JSR validator exists but a\nSpring's `Validator` exists and is primary, we shouldn't flag the\nauto-configured one as `@Primary`. Previous iterations on this feature\nhave made sure that we'll auto-configure at most one\n`javax.validation.Validator` so not flagging it `@Primary` is no problem.\n\nThis commit also restores and adds tests that validates\n`ValidationAutoConfiguration` will configure a JSR validator even if a\nSpring Validator is present.\n\nThis effectively fixes gh-8495 in a different way.\n\nCloses gh-8979\nCloses gh-8976"}
