In 2.1.0, this led to a startup failure due to the latter\nattempting to override the bean defined by the former. In addition to the override there\nwere also problems with the order of the filter as Jersey uses -1 and MVC uses -105.\n\nTo avoid the above-described problems, the auto-configuration of the RequestContextFilter\nwas removed from JerseyAutoConfiguration in 2.1.1. Unfortunately, the broke\nrequest-scoped beans for those using only Jersey.\n\nThis commit attempts to strike a better balance by reintroducing the auto-configuration\nof RequestContextFilter in JerseyAutoConfiguration. It will back off if the user defines\ntheir own filter or filter registration. WebMvcAutoConfiguration has been updated to\nback off in the same manner. This leaves the potential for ordering problems, but they\nare no worse than they were before. Furthermore, the user has the means to correct any\nproblems by using the various filter ordering properties that are provided for Jersey,\nSpring Session, Spring Security, etc.\n\nCloses gh-15376"}
