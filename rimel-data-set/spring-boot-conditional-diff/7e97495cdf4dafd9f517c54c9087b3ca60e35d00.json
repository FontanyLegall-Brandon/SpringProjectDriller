This commit removes `JolokiaMvcEndpoint` and exposes\nthe servlet directly instead while still being part of the\nmanagement context. As such, the Jolokia servlet is exposed beneath\nthe management context path and will move to a separate port when\nthe management port is not the same as the main server port.\n\nCloses gh-9843"}
