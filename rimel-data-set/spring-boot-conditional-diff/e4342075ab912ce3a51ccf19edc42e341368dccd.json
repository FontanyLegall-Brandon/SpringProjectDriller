This would\nresult in a ClassCastException if the attribute was an instance of a\nclass visible to the restart class loader.\n\nThis commit auto-configures Spring Session\u2019s RedisTemplate to use a\ncustom deserializer that uses the restart class loader when\ndeserializing session attributes.\n\nCloses gh-3805"}
