If we\nswitch it to a regular @Controller (which are now supported in the\nchild context if there is one) then it won't disappear under the\nmanagement.context-path.\n\nAlso use lazy request matching in ignores as well as secure paths.\nThe problem was that the ignores were constructed eagerly from the\nactuator paths before they were available (the EndpointHandlerMapping\nneeds to be lazily accessed to avoid a security-induced bean creation\ncascade).\n\nFixes gh-4624"}
