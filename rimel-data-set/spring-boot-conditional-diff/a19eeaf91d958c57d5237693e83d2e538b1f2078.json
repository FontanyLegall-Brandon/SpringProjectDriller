{"author_date": "2016-04-19 11:26:37+01:00", "msg": "DevTools should only shut down single, auto-configured DataSource\n\nPreviously, there were two problems with DevTools\u2019 DataSource\nauto-configuration:\n\n1. It did not tolerate a context with multiple DataSources\n2. It would attempt to shut down a DataSource that had not been created\n   by DataSourceAutoConfiguration and, therefore, where we could not be\n   sure of its configuration.\n\nThis commit updates DevToolsDataSourceAutoConfiguration so that it backs\noff unless the context contains DataSourceProperties and a single\nDataSource created by DataSourceAutoConfiguration. This ensures that it\ncan safely use DataSourceProperties to get the DataSource\u2019s\ndriver class name and accurately determine if it\u2019s an in-memory or\nexternal database. Shutdown is only called for an in-memory database.\n\nCloses gh-5540"}
