The endpoint resource endpoints are now added\nwith a registrar bean `@PostConstruct` method.\n\nPrior to this commit, when running the management server on a different\nport a `Resource` added by a customizer could be added two different\n`ResourceConfig` instance. This breaks the singleton contract expected\nby Jersey.\n\nFixes gh-17801\n\nCo-authored-by: Phillip Webb <pwebb@pivotal.io>"}
