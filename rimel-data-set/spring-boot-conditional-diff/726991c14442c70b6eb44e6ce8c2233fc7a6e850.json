Prior to this commit, an embedded broker was only\nstarted when it was requested explicitly by a configuration option.\n\nThis is inconsistent with the ActiveMQ support and boot favors the\neasiest route. If the necessary classes are available, HornetQ is\nembedded in the application by default.\n\nFixes gh-1029"}
