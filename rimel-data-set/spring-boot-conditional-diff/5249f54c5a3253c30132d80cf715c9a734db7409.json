To be able to quickly switch between\nHikari and the other types of DataSource there's a minute shim for translating\nthe common properties (username, password, url, driverClassName), but actually\nonly url is different. The shim and also DataSource initialization is supported\nthrough DataSourceProperties, but the other native properties get bound directly\nthrough the concrete runtime type of the DataSource.\n\nThe /configprops endpoint works (and is exposed in the actuator sample).\n\nFixes gh-840, fixes gh-477, see also gh-808."}
