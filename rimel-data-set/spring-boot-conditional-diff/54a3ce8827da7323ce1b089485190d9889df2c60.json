If this\nproperty is set to an unsupported `DataSource` implementation, we now\nproperly create it again, rather than ignoring it because its value did\nnot match any value we support.\n\nSince Spring Boot 1.4 now redirects `DataSource` implementation settings\nto dedicated namespaces, the documentation has been updated to explicitly\nmention how one can create such arrangement for an unsupported\nimplementation.\n\nAs a convenience, `DataSourceProperties` can initialize a\n`DataSourceBuilder` based on its internal state, making it very easy for\nanyone to create a `DataSource` from a `DataSourceProperties` instance.\n\nCloses gh-6695"}
