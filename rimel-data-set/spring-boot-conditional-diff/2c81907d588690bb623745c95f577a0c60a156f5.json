If this property has a value of\nzero and randomly allocated port will be used. In such an event, the\nMongoClient created by MongoAutoConfiguration will be automatically\nconfigured to use the port that was allocated.\n\nBy default, MongoDB 2.6.10 will be used. This can be configured using\nthe spring.embedded-mongodb.version property. Mongo's sync delay\nfeature is enabled by default. This can be configured using the\nspring.embedded-mongobd.features property.\n\nCloses gh-2002"}
