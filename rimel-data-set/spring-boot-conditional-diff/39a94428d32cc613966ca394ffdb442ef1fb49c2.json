The ordering problem\nis still there really (it's not defined which repositories will\nbe created by the autoconfig), so if a user is going to have\n2 repository implementations on the classpath, he is going to\nhave to either choose one to disable, or manualy @Enable* the\nother one.\n\nFixes gh-1042"}
