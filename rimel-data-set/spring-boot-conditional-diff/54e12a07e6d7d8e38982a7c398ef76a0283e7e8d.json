{"author_date": "2015-03-12 08:31:21+01:00", "msg": "Add start/stop goals to maven plugin\n\nSpringApplicationLifecycle provides lifecycle operations on the current\nSpring Boot application. It can be registered as an MBean of the platform\nMBean server if a specific property is set. Besides, the JMX name can\nalso be customized via a property in case more than one Spring Boot\napplication is started in the same process.\n\nThe Maven plugin uses that MBean to check that the application is ready\nbefore ending the \"start\" phase. It uses it to trigger a proper shutdown\nof the application during the \"stop\" phase.\n\nIf the process has to be forked, the platform MBean server is exposed on\na configurable port so that the maven plugin can connect to it.\n\nSuch change permits the maven plugin to integrate a classical integration\ntest scenario where the \"start\" goal is invoked during the\npre-integration phase and the \"stop\" goal during the post-integration\nphase.\n\nCloses gh-2525"}
