They were only processed\ndue to being imported by HttpMessageConvertersAutoConfiguration.\nIn addition to being misleadingly named, this meant that they could\nnot be included or excluded individually and were also tightly coupled\nto HTTP message conversion.\n\nThis commit updates spring.factories to make both\nJacksonAutoConfiguration and GsonAutoConfiguration actual\nauto-configuration classes. As a result, they can now be enabled or\ndisabled individually and are no longer coupled to HTTP message\nconversion.\n\nCloses gh-1562"}
