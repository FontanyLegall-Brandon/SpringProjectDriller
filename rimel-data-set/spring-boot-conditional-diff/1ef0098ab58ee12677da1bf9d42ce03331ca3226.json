This instrumentation happens\nautomatically only if you create an instance of `WebClient` using an\nauto-configured `WebClient.Builder` bean.\n\nThis infrastructure is reusing de facto the `MeterFilter` that has been\nadded for `RestTemplate` in order to limit the \"uri\" tag cardinality.\n\nCloses gh-12228"}
