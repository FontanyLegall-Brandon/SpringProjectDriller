This arrangement isn't ideal\nsince the `LdapTemplate` is a part of Spring LDAP project, and therefore\nshould not be tied to Spring Data LDAP.\n\nThis commit improves and simplifies LDAP auto-configuration by moving\n`LdapTemplate` configuration to `LdapAutoConfiguration`. Consequently,\n`LdapDataAutoConfiguration` is not needed anymore and is removed.\n\nSee gh-13136"}
