If a bean you add is of a type that would have been included\nby default anyway (like MappingJackson2HttpMessageConverter for JSON\nconversions) then it will replace the default value. A convenience\nbean is provided of type MessageConverters (always available if you\nuse the default MVC configuration) which has some useful methods to\naccess the default and user-enhanced message converters (useful, for\nexample if you want to manually inject them into a custom\nRestTemplate).\n\nThere are also some convenient configuration shortcuts for Jackson2.\nThe smallest change that might work is to just add beans of type\nModule to your context. They will be registered with the default\nObjectMapper and then injected into the default message\nconverter. In addition, if your context contains any beans of type\nObjectMapper then all of the Module beans will be registered with\nall of the mappers."}
