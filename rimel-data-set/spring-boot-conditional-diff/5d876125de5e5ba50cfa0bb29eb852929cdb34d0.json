So far this was a\npilot error so we didn't have to care about it. Now that we have an\nauto-configuration that may lead to this error, we need to be extra\ncareful and check that scenario ourselves.\n\nThis commit adds an extra condition that runs as late as possible and\nattempt to actually initialize a `Validator`. If that fails for whatever\nreason, the auto-configuration will now back off.\n\nSeveral additional tests have been added to exercise this scenario.\n\nCloses gh-6228"}
