This cycle\ncaused a BeanCurrentlyInCreationException to be thrown when the\nbean method was active (the spring.metrics.export.statsd.host property\nwas set).\n\nThis commit break the cycle by moving the bean method into a separate,\nnested configuration class. It also updates the existing test for\nauto-configuration of a Statsd writer to catch any possible cycles\nand to verify that the writer has be registered with the\nMetricsExporter.\n\nCloses gh-6544"}
