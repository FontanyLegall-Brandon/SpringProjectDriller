Used by auto-configuration that relies on a single candidate of\na given type (for instance, the JdbcTemplate auto-configuration relies on\nthe presence of a DataSource).\n\nSuch wiring by type will succeed if only one bean of that type is present\nor if one matching instance is flagged \"primary\" amongst the candidates.\n\nConditionalOnSingleCandidate is a basic version of ConditionalOnBean that\nonly accepts a single type and does not determine a defaut based on its\npresence on a bean definition.\n\nCloses gh-1702"}
