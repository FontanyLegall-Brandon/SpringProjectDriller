Additionally,\nthe plugin can be configured to write an arbitrary number of additional\nproperties.\n\nA new `BuildProperties` bean is automatically exposed when such a file is\npresent. If that bean is present, an `InfoContributor` is automatically\ncreated to expose that information under the `build` key.\n\nAs for the git contributor, it is possible to only display the core\nsettings or everything using the `management.info.build.mode` property.\n\nSee gh-2559"}
