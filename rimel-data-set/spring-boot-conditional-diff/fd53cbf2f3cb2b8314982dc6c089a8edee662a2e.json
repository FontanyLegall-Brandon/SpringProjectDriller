The custom Flyway bean would switch off\nauto-configuration of the FlywayMigrationInitializer bean but the\ncontext\u2019s entity manager factory beans would still be configured to\ndepend on the migration initialiser.\n\nThis commit splits the post-processor that configures the dependencies\ninto two. One that configures the dependency on the Flyway bean and\none that configures the dependency on the FlywayMigrationInitializer\nbean. When to auto-configuration of the FlywayMigrationInitializer is\nswitched off, the auto-configuration of the latter dependency is also\nswitched off.\n\nCloses gh-4079"}
