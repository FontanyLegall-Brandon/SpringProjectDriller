This new filter is building on the\nprevious one and supports HTTP DELETE requests as well.\n\nBoth filters should not be used in addition, so the former\nconfiguration has been removed. This commit also adds configuration\nmetadata to let developers know about the configuration key change.\n\nCloses: gh-13363"}
