Links are now available from `/links` and\nthe HAL browser is available from `/hal`.\n\nThe actuator HAL browser now works with either WebJars or the Spring\nData version. It also now transforms the initial HTML so that the\nform is pre-populated with `/links`.\n\nWhen using Spring Data's HAL browser, the root includes a link to\n`/links` with a rel of `actuator`.\n\nSee gh-3621"}
