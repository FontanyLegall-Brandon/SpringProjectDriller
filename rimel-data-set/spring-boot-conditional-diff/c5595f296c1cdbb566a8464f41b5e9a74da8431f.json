{"author_date": "2017-02-24 17:13:14+01:00", "msg": "Add support for Mock test with WebFlux\n\nThis commit add mock support for WebFlux with an infrastructure similar\nto what `WebMvcTest` provides. `@WebFluxTest` can be used to test\ncontrollers with a narrowed classpath that is relevant to WebFlux. Also,\n`@SpringBootTest` now starts WebFlux in \"mock\" mode by default and\n`@AutoConfigureWebTestClient` can be used to inject a `WebTestClient`\nconnected to the `ApplicationContext`.\n\nTo make that happen, a `ReactiveWebApplicationContext` interface has been\nintroduced to mirror what `WebApplicationContext` currently does. Things\nare still a bit volatile at this point and that infra may move to Spring\nFramework at some point.\n\nCloses gh-8401"}
