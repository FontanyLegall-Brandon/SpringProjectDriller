Prior to this commit, an\nexception would be thrown if any related class such as the parent\nclass does not exist.\n\nThis commit handles this additional case, catching `NoClassDefFoundError`\nthe same way it did handle `ClassNotFoundException`. That way, a\nmissing type will now be considered as absent if it's not on the\nclasspath.\n\nCloses gh-7459"}
