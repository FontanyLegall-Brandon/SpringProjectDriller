{"author_date": "2016-09-22 16:52:22-07:00", "msg": "Add `/loggers` actuator endpoint\n\nAdd `LoggersEndpoint` that can enables listing and configuration of log\nlevels. This actuator builds on top of the `LoggingSystem` abstraction\nand implements support for Logback, Log4J2, and JUL.  The LoggingSystem\ninterface is modified to require each implementation to list the\nconfiguration of all loggers as well as an individual logger by name.\n\nThe MVC endpoint exposes these behaviors at `GET /loggers` and\n`GET /loggers/{name}` (much like the metrics actuator).\n\nIn addition `POST /loggers/{name}` allows users to modify the level for a given\nlogger. This modification is passed to the logging implementation, which\nthen decides, as an internal implementation detail, what the final outcome\nof the modification is (e.g. changing all unconfigured children). Users\nare then expected to request the listing of all loggers to see what has\nchanged internally to the logging system.\n\nCloses gh-7086"}
