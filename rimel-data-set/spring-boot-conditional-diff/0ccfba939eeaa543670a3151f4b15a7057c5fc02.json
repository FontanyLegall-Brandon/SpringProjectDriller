It was a good idea to have a filetr chain\ntriggered by the flag being off because it smooths the way for user-defined\nfilter chains to use the Boot AuthenticationManager (as a first step at least),\nbut it wasn't a goog idea to add any actual secuity features to that filter.\nE.g. if it has HSTS then even an app like Sagan that has some secure endpoints\nthat it manages itself and the rest is unsecured has issues because it can't\naccept connections over HTTP even on unsecure endpoints.\n\nTODO: find a way for security.ssl_enabled=true to apply to only the user-\ndefined security filter (maybe not possible or worth the effort, since they\ncan inject a SecurityProperties if they need it?).\n\nSee gh-928"}
