{"author_date": "2017-10-16 21:55:05+02:00", "msg": "Support error conventions in Spring WebFlux\n\nThis commit adds support for Spring Boot error conventions with WebFlux.\nThe Spring MVC support for that is based on an `Controller` that's\nmapped on a specific `\"/error\"` path and configured as an error page in\nthe Servlet container. With WebFlux, this support leverages a\n`WebExceptionHandler`, which catches exceptions flowing through the\nreactive pipeline and handles them.\n\nThe `DefaultErrorWebExceptionHandler` supports the following:\n* return a JSON error response to machine clients\n* return error HTML views (templates, static or default HTML view)\n\nOne can customize the error information by contributing an\n`ErrorAttributes` bean to the application context.\n\nSpring Boot provides an `ErrorWebExceptionHandler` marker interface and a\nbase implementation that provides high level constructs to handle\nerrors, based on the Spring WebFlux functional flavor.\nThe error handling logic can be completely changed by providing a custom\n`RouterFunction` there.\n\nFixes gh-8625"}
