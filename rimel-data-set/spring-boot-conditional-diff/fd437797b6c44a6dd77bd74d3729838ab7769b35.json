If no package is provided, scanning now defaults to\nthe \"auto-configured\" package(s) and a `@NodeEntityScan` annotation\nallows to override that.\n\nThe configuration has also been updated to detect the driver based on the\n`uri` property. If the embedded driver is available we use that by\ndefault. If it is not available, we're trying to connect to a Neo4j\nserver running on localhost. It is possible to disable the embedded mode\nor set the `uri` parameter explicitly to deviate from these defaults.\n\nThe sample no longer relies on the embedded driver for licensing reason:\nrather it expects an instance running on localhost (like other\ndata-related samples) and gracefully ignore any connection error. A\nREADME has been added in the sample to further explain the available\noptions;\n\nCloses gh-5458"}
