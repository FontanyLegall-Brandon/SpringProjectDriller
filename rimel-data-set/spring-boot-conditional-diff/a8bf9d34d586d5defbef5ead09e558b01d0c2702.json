{"author_date": "2015-04-07 17:24:45+01:00", "msg": "Honour endpoint.enabled:false for nested paths\n\nPreviously, only invocations of /metricName/ would honour the enabled\nproperty and return a not found (404) response. For endpoints which\nsupport nested paths, access to /metricName/foo would ignore the enabled\nflag and return an OK (200) response. Furthermore, there was a comment\nin EndpointMvcAdapter that suggested that an endpoint shouldn\u2019t be\ncalled when it is disabled, however this was not the case.\n\nThis commit updates EndpointWebMvcAutoConfiguration and\nJolokiaAutoConfiguration to only register their MvcEndpoint beans if\nthe underlying endpoint is enabled. This means that an\nEndpointMvcAdapter should not be called if its delegate is disabled,\nmaking the comment described above accurate.\n\nThe check for the delegate being enabled has been retained so as not to\nrely upon the auto-configurations\u2019 behaviour. The methods which handle\nnested paths (MetricsMvcEndpoint.value() and\nEnvironmentMvcEndpoint.value()) have been updated to add the same check\nfor the enablement of their delegate.\n\nFixes gh-2767"}
