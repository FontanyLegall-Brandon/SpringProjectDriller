The assumption is that if the user has declared\na MongoDbFactory they will either use it directly, or they will also\nregister a Mongo bean.\n\nIf the MongoDbFactory class cannot be found the existing Mongo\nauto-configuration still applies. This ensures that users that do\nnot have Spring Data can still access a Mongo bean.\n\nFixes gh-1341"}
