A configuration switch allows to enable an embedded\nmode that starts HornetQ as part of the application.\n\nIn such a mode, the spring.hornetq.embedded.* properties provide\nadditional options to configure the embedded broker. In particular,\nmessage persistence and data directory locations can be specified. It is\nalso possible to define the queue(s) and topic(s) to create on startup.\n\nFixes: gh-765"}
