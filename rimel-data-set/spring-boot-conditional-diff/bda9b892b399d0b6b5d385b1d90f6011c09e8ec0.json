Both\nSpring MVC and Spring WebFlux are supported.\n\nThis feature is primarily for use when deeper Spring integration is\nrequired or when existing Spring Boot 1.5 projects want to migrate to\nSpring Boot 2.0 without re-writing existing endpoints. It comes at the\nexpense of portability, since such endpoints will be missing from\nJersey.\n\nFixes gh-10257"}
