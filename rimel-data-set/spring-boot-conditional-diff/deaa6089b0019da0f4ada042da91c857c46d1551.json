Rather than creating a\n`HttpHandler` in that auto-configuration, this commit moves it to a\ndedicated auto-config, like we do for `DispatcherServlet` for\nservlet-based webapps.\n\nAs this is the only bean we auto-configure in a functional fashion, the\n`WebFluxFunctionalAutoConfiguration` is now merged with this new\nauto-configuration, making its purposes clearer.\n\nCloess gh-8436"}
