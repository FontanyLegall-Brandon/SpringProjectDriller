This commit brings us into line with that announcement by\nremoving the auto-configuration that would create an Elasticsearch\nNode and NodeClient.\n\nTo use the Elasticsearch auto-configuration, a user must now provide\nthe address of one or more cluster nodes\n(via the spring.elastisearch.cluster-nodes property) which will then\nbe used to create a TransportClient.\n\nSee gh-9374\n\n[1] https://www.elastic.co/blog/elasticsearch-the-server"}
