{"author_date": "2014-06-06 19:03:33+02:00", "msg": "Add OnPropertyValueCondition annotation\n\nThis commit adds a new conditional annotation that checks if a\nproperty has a given value. This allows to replace constructs\nsuch as\n\n@ConditionalOnExpression(\"'${app.myProperty:foo}' == 'foo'\")\n\nto\n\n@ConditionalOnPropertyValue(property=\"app.myProperty\",\n        value=\"foo\", defaultMatch=true)\n\nWhich is definitely more verbose but has the following advantages:\n\n1. Works by default if the actual property in the environment is\n   a bit different (i.e. my-property)\n2. Works if the value of the property has a diferent case (FoO or\n   FOO would match)\n3. Gives a precise reporting in the auto configuration report\n\nThe defaultMatch flag is meant to mention that the condition should\nalso match if the value is not set; the auto-config report would\nalso have an explicit report about it.\n\nFixes gh-1000"}
