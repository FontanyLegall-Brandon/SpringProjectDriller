The data.sql\nscript if it exists is still executed on an event fired from the\nother places, so those tests are passing.\n\nFlyway and liquibase have bean factory post processors (like\nthe one they use to order the audit aspect in Spring Data) that\nenforce a dependency on those components from the EntityManagerFactory.\nSo Hibernate validation is still happy (and there are 2 tests to\nprove it now as well).\n\nFixes gh-1022"}
