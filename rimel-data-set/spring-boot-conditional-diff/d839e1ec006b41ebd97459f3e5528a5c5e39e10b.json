{"author_date": "2016-06-14 15:46:06+01:00", "msg": "Remove redundant restart-compatible Redis serializer\n\nPreviously, Spring Data Redis assumed that the class loader that loaded\nits classes would also be able to load the application\u2019s classes. This\nassumption is faulty when there are multiple class loaders involved\nsuch as when using dev tools or when Spring Data Redis is installed as\na shared library in a servlet container.\n\nDATAREDIS-427 and DATAREDIS-501 removed this assumption by making the\ndefault serialiser use the bean class loader. DevTools configures this\nclass loader to be the restart class loader which can load the\napplication\u2019s classes. As a result of moving to Hopper SR2 snapshots,\nthese fixes are now available and we can remove our custom serialised.\n\nCloses gh-5760"}
