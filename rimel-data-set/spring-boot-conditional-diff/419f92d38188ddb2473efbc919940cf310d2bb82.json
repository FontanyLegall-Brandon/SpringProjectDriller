{"author_date": "2019-09-24 11:13:35+01:00", "msg": "Tune @ConditionalOnMissingBean for interface-based back off\n\nPreviously, a number of usages of @ConditionalOnMissingBean prevented\na bean that implements an auto-configured bean's \"main\" interface from\ncausing the auto-configuration of the bean to back off. This would\nhappen when @ConditionalOnMissingBean did not specify a type, the\n@Bean method returned the bean's concrete type, and that concreate\ntype implements a \"main\" interface.\n\nThis commit updates such usages of @ConditionalOnMissingBean to\nspecify the \"main\" interface as the type of the bean that must be\nmissing. This will allow, for example, the auto-configured\nMongoTemplate bean to back off when a MongoOperations bean is defined.\n\nFixes gh-18101"}
