{"author_date": "2014-10-03 10:37:02+02:00", "msg": "Support Jackson based XML serialization and Jackson2ObjectMapperBuilder\n\nThis commit introduces support for Jackson based XML serialization, using the\nnew MappingJackson2XmlHttpMessageConverter provided by Spring Framework\n4.1. It is automatically activated when Jackson XML extension is detected on the\nclasspath.\n\nJackson2ObjectMapperBuilder is now used to create ObjectMapper and XmlMapper\ninstances with the following customized properties:\n - MapperFeature.DEFAULT_VIEW_INCLUSION is disabled\n - DeserializationFeature.FAIL_ON_UNKNOWN_PROPERTIES is disabled\n\nJodaModuleAutoConfiguration and Jsr310ModuleAutoConfiguration have been removed\nsince their behaviors are now handled directly by the ObjectMapper builder.\n\nIn addition to the existing @Bean of type ObjectMapper support, it is now\npossible to customize Jackson based serialization properties by declaring\na @Bean of type Jackson2ObjectMapperBuilder.\n\nFixes gh-1237\nFixes gh-1580\nFixes gh-1644"}
