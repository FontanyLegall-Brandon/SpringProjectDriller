{"author_date": "2014-11-18 15:51:30+00:00", "msg": "Apply spring.jackson.* config to HypermediaAutoConfiguration\u2019s ObjectMapper\n\nPreviously, HypermediaAutoConfiguration would trigger the creation of\nan ObjectMapper bean named _halObjectMapper. This bean did not have the\nspring.jackson.* configuration applied to it, however its presence\nwould revent JacksonAutoConfiguration from creating its\nObjectMapper. This left the user with an ObjectMapper that did not\nhonour the spring.jackson.* configuration.\n\nThis commit updates HypermediaAutoConfiguration to use the\nJackson2ObjectMapperBuilder that may have been created by\nJacksonAutoConfiguration. If the builder exists it is used to configure\nthe _halObjectMapper bean.\n\nFixes gh-1949"}
