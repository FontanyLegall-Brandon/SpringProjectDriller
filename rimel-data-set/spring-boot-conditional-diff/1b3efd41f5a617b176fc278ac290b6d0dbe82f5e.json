This is the case for ehCache, hazelcast and JCache. This change has\ntwo side effects:\n\n1. It is now possible to customize the underlying cache infrastructure\nand let Boot only wrap it in the Spring's CacheManager abstraction. No\ncustomizations are applied if the caching-specific service is customized\n2. Such infrastructure is disposed when the application terminates as\nit is now defined as `@Bean` and both `close()` and `shutdown()` methods\nare invoked if present on the target type.\n\nWhile the latter can be troublesome, we feel that a particular cache\ninstance is not meant to be shared and must be disposed when the\napplication terminates.\n\nCloses gh-2848"}
