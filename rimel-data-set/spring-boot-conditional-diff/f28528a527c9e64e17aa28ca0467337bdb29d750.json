{"author_date": "2018-08-14 17:07:11+01:00", "msg": "Allow Data JPA's bootstrap mode to be configured via the environment\n\nIn Spring Data Lovelace, repositories' bootstrap mode can be\nconfigured via @EnableJpaRepositories. This commit adds support for\nconfiguring the mode via the environment rather than having to use\nthe annotation. Additionally, when deferred or lazy bootstrapping is\nbeing used, the LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean is configured\nto use a bootstrap executor. This allows JPA's initialization to be\nperformed on a separate thread, allowing the rest of application\ncontext initialization to proceed in parallel.\n\nCloses gh-13833"}
