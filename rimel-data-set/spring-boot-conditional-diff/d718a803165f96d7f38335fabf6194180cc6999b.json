{"author_date": "2015-02-04 17:34:14+00:00", "msg": "Make it easier to use Gson and the Actuator at the same time\n\nPreviously the recommendation when a user wanted to use Gson was to\nexclude Jackson from the classpath and add Gson. This worked fine until\nthe user also want to use the Actuator which requires Jackson. To get\nover this hurdle the user could leave Jackson on the classpath and\nperform their own HttpMessageConverter configuration and register a\nGsonHttpMessageConverter instead of or before any Jackson-based\nconverter. A little complicated, but it worked.\n\nThis commit makes things easier by updating the auto-configuration for\nHTTP message converters to prefer Gson when both Gson and Jackson are\non the classpath, i.e. in the presence of both, a\nGsonHttpMessageConverter will be auto-configured and a\nMappingJackson2HttpMessageConverter won\u2019t be. This allows an\napplication to easily use Gson while allowing the Actuator to continue\nto use Jackson.\n\nCloses gh-2247"}
