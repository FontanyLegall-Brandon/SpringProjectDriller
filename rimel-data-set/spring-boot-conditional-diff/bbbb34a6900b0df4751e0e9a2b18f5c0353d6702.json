At the moment the size of the cache and\nthe hit/miss ratios are recorded. Cache metrics are exposed via the\n`cache.` prefix followed by the name of the cache. In case of conflict,\nthe name of the cache manager is added as a qualifier.\n\nIt is possible to easily register a new CacheStatisticsProvider for an\nunsupported cache system and the CacheStatistics object itself can be\nextended to provide additional metrics.\n\nSee gh-2633\nCloses gh-2770"}
