{"author_date": "2016-02-22 14:28:34+01:00", "msg": "Fix Hazelcast Cache auto-configuration ordering\n\nSpring Boot supports the automatic configuration of an additional\nHazelcastInstance if one already exists and an explicit property has been\nset to use a different configuration for caching. So three cases are\nsupported really: no `HazelcastInstance` exists so we need to create one\nanyway or an `HazelcastInstance` already exists; in that latter case, we\nshould either reuse it or create a new one.\n\nUnfortunately, the conditions that checked those three use cases were\nnot ordered consistently and we could easily get in a situation where\nboth conditions were evaluated.\n\nThis commit makes sure that we  first check if an `HazelcastInstance`\nexists and then (and only then) we create the missing `HazelcastInstance`\nused for caching. The tests have also been improved to validate the\nproper `HazelcastInstance` is used for caching.\n\nCloses gh-5181"}
