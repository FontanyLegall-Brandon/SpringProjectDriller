{"author_date": "2014-10-20 10:14:53+01:00", "msg": "Fix ArrayStoreException caused by JerseyAutoConfiguration again\n\nThis is a follow-on from the changes made in 2b7bf3e. In addition to the\nproblematic use of @ConditionalOnClass that was addressed in 2b7bf3e,\nJerseyAutoConfiguration also used @ConditionalOnBean referencing a \nJersey class. This has the same problem when used on a class that\nimplements WebApplicationInitializer. Implementing\nWebApplicationInitializer causes the class\u2019s annotations to be\nintrospected during servlet container initialiser processing. If a\n@ConditionalOnBean annotation references a Class that cannot be\nloaded an ArrayStoreException occurs.\n\nThis commit updates JerseyAutoConfiguration to reference ResourceConfig\nas a String. This allows it annotations to be introspected without\nattempting to load a Jersey class that may not be on the classpath.\n\nFixes gh-1733\nFixes gh-1719"}
