This means that the auto-configured bean can\nonly be switched off by a JobExecutionExitCodeGenerator bean, rather\nthan any bean that implements ExitCodeGenerator.\n\nThis commit corrects the use of @ConditionalOnMissingBean to allow any\nExitCodeGenerator bean to switch off the auto-configured one.\n\nCloses gh-4752"}
