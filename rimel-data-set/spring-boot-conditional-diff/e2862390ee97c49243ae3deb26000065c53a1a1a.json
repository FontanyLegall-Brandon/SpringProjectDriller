This\nprevented RemoteSpringApplication from uploading changes to the server\nas they would be rejected with a 401.\n\nThis commit updates RemoteDevToolsAutoConfiguration to allow anonymous\naccess to the remote server. CSRF protection is also disabled so that\nPOST requests without a CSRF token will be accepted.\n\nCloses gh-3889"}
