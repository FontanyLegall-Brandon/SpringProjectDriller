This retrieval could take over one minute in some\ncases even when Couchbase is health. This latency is too large for a health\ncheck.\n\nThe Couchbase team have recommended the of a Cluster#diagnostics instead.\nThis provides a much lower latency view of the cluster's health. This\ncommit updates CouchbaseHealthIndicator to use Cluster#diagnostics while\nretaining support, in a deprecated form, for the old info-based mechanism\nshould anyone want to opt back into that in 2.0.x.\n\nCloses gh-14685"}
