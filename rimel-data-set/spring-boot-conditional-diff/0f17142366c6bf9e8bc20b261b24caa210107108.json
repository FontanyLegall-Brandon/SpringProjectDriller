{"author_date": "2014-10-30 15:18:39+00:00", "msg": "Make GroovyWebConfiguration conditional on spring-webmvc's availability\n\nGroovyWebConfiguration creates a GroovyTemplateViewResolver which is\na UrlBasedViewResolver sub-class. UrlBasedViewResolver is provided\nby spring-webmvc. Previously, if a user configured a web application\nbut did not have spring-webmvc on the classpath, the application\nwould fail to start with a NoClassDefFoundError for\nUrlBasedViewResolver.\n\nThis commit makes GroovyWebConfiguration conditional on\nUrlBasedViewResolver being on the classpath so that it backs of in\nthe absence of spring-webmvc.\n\nFixes gh-1793"}
