If a parent class\u2019s conditions match in\nPARSE_CONFIGURATION then its inner classes will have their\nPARSE_CONFIGURATION conditions evaluated. If they all match, the inner\nclass will be reported as a positive match in the auto-configuration\nreport even if the outer class does not match as a result of the\nsubsequent evaluation of a REGISTER_BEAN condition.\n\nFixes gh-2122"}
