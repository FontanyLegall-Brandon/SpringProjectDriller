{"author_date": "2014-10-13 11:16:55+01:00", "msg": "Fix ArrayStoreException caused by JerseyAutoConfiguration\n\nJerseyAutoConfiguration is annotated with @ConditionalOnClass. It\nreferences both SpringComponentProvider.class and\nServletRegistration.class. Normally, this wouldn't be a problem as, in\nthe absence of either of those classes, the configuration class bean\nwill not be present in the bean factory and, therefore, its\nannotations will never be introspected using reflection.\n\nHowever, JerseyAutoConfiguration is a WebApplicationInitializer. This\nmeans that when it's deployed to a standalone container,\nJerseyAutoConfiguration is found by the container and its class is\npassed to SpringServletContainerInitializer.\nSpringServletContainerInitializer introspects every\nWebApplicationInitializer class so that it can order them. This blows\nup if Jersey's SpringComponentProvider class isn't on the classpath as\nthe annotation is referencing SpringComponentProvider as a Class and\nthe attempt to load it fails. The problem can be avoided by\nreferencing SpringComponentProvider using a String.\n\nFixes gh-1696"}
