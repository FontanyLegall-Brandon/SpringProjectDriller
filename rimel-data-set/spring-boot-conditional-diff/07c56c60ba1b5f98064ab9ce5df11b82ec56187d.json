This\nprevents the case where the JCache bootstrap actually starts an instance\nearly, followed by a second (potentially unwanted) instance created by the\nregular auto-configuration.\n\nSince the JCache implementation works with an `HazelcastInstance` behind\nthe scenes, if there is one `HazelcastInstance` configured and it has a\nname, then we configure the `CacheProvider` to use that. Future Hazelcast\nversion will allow to pass the instance directly (i.e. not requiring an\nactual name).\n\nCloses gh-8484"}
