This didn't cause a\nfailure as all of its beans were disabled. It was, however, wasteful,\nas the configuration class was processed and a bean created for it\nunnecessarily.\n\nThis commit makes the whole class conditional on the presence of\nspring-security-web so that it will be skipped entirely when the\ndependency is not available.\n\nCloses gh-4160"}
