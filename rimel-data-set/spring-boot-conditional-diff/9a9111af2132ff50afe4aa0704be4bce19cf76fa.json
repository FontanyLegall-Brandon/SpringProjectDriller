This\nmechanism isn't very explicit and also makes it hard for us to relocate\nthat property in Spring Boot 2.1.\n\nThis commit also reverts most of fddc9e9c7e since it is now clear that\nthe supporting multiple dispatcher servlet paths will be much more\ninvolved that we originally anticipated.\n\nCloses gh-13834"}
