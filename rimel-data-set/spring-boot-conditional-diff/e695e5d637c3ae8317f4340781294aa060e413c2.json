{"author_date": "2014-05-15 16:18:16+02:00", "msg": "Revisit JMS support\n\nSince ActiveMQ 5.8.0, the modules structure has been revisited and\nactivemq-core no longer exists. The activemq-broker is required to\ncreate an embedded broker. Since Boot creates such broker by default\nif ConnectionFactory is present, a condition has been added to do so\nonly when the necessary classes are present in the classpath.\n\nThe default embedded broker is now configured to disable message\npersistence altogether as this requires an extra jar since 5.8.0, i.e.\nactivemq-kahadb-store.\n\nSplit the ActiveMQ auto configuration from the JmsTemplate auto\nconfiguration so these are totally independent.\nActiveMQAutoConfiguration has been created to detect and configure\nthe ActiveMQ broker if necessary.\n\nThe brokerUrl parameter was ignored as long as the inMemory parameter\nwas true. The actual brokerUrl to use is now determined by the user\ndefined values of those parameters: if the brokerUrl is set, it is always\nused. If no brokerUrl is set, the value of inMemory determines if an\nembedded broker should be used (true) or a tcp connection to an\nexisting local broker (false).\n\nJmsTemplateAutoConfiguration now creates a JmsTemplate only if a\nConnectionFactory is available.\n\nFixes gh-872, gh-882, gh-883"}
