The\n\"spring.cache.mode\" allows the user to specify the cache provider that\nshould be auto-configured. If no explicit configuration is provided,\nthe environment is checked for the best suited cache implementation,\nthat is:\n\n- Generic if at least one `Cache` bean is defined in the context.\n- Hazelcast if either a default configuration file is present or the\n  `spring.cache.config` property is set.\n- JCache if one JSR-107 provider is present\n- Redis if a `RedisTemplate` is defined in the context\n- Guava\n- Simple as a fallback option, using concurrent maps\n- NoOp (that is, no cache) if the mode is set to \"none\"\n\nIf the provider supports it, it is possible to specify the caches\nto create on startup via `spring.cache.cache-names`. If the provider\nrelies on a configuration file and a custom one needs to be used\n`spring.cache.config` can be set to such custom resource.\n\nIf more than one JSR-107 provider is present, it is possible to force\nthe provider to use by setting the mode to `jcache` and specifying the\nfully qualified class name of the CachingProvider to use via\n`spring.cache.jcache.provider`.\n\nSee gh-2633"}
