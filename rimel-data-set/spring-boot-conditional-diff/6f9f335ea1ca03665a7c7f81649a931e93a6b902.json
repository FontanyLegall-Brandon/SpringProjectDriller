{"author_date": "2014-09-12 14:19:10-05:00", "msg": "Add additional class conditions for JTA auto-configuration\n\nPreviously, JTA auto-configuration would fail with a variety of\nClassNotFoundExceptions and NoClassDefFoundErrors if it was used with\nan \u201cincomplete\u201d classpath. This commit adds a number of classes to\n@ConditionalOnClass annotations so that the auto-configuration backs\noff gracefully in the absence of certain classes.\n\nSpecifically, the following now work as expected:\n\n - Deploying an app to a server with JTA available via JNDI when the\n   app does not use transactions\n - Auto-configuration of Atomikos without JMS\n - Auto-configuration of Bitronix without JMS\n\nBoth XADataSourceAutoConfiguration and JndiDataSourceAutoConfiguration\nhave been updated to back off in the absence of spring-jdbc; a\ndependency of DataSourceProperties which is used by both classes.\n\nError handling in AtomikosDependsOnBeanFactoryPostProcessor and\nBitronixDependentBeanFactoryPostProcessor has been enhanced so that the\ncorrect dependencies are established, even in the absence of JMS.\n\nFixes gh-1538"}
