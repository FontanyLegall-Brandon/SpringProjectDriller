While\nActiveMQAutoConfiguration is namely shielded with a condition on a\nmissing ConnectionFactory bean, said configuration class also imports the\nXA and regular configuration classes that both can create the connection\nfactory.\n\nThis commit adds a ConditionalOnMissingBean in the second class that is\nimported in case the XA configuration has already defined what it needs.\n\nFixes gh-1727"}
