{"author_date": "2015-08-12 12:14:12+01:00", "msg": "Update devtools to customise environment before app context is refreshed\n\nPrior to this commit, the devtools used bean factory post processors to\nconfigure the environment with custom, development-time properties. This\nmeant that the environment was configured as part of the application\ncontext being refreshed. Crucially, this happened after any property\nconditions were evaluated making it impossible for the devtools to\nchange the default auto-configuration behaviour for a bean or\nconfiguration class that was conditional on a property.\n\nThis commit moves the configuration of the environment into an\nApplicationListener that listens for the\nApplicationEnvironmentPreparedEvent which is published as soon as the\nEnvironment has been prepared and before the application context is\nrefreshed.\n\nCloses gh-3726"}
