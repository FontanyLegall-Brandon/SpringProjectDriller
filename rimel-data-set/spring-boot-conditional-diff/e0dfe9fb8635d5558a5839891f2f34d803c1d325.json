{"author_date": "2015-03-12 08:31:21+01:00", "msg": "Add start/stop goals to maven plugin\n\nSpringApplicationLifecycle provides basic lifecycle operations on the\ncurrent Spring Boot application (that is checking if the application has\nfully started and gracefully terminate the app). It can be registered as\nan MBean of the platform MBean server if a specific property is set.\n\nThe Maven plugin uses that MBean to check that the application is ready\nbefore ending the \"start\" phase. It uses it to trigger a proper shutdown\nof the application during the \"stop\" phase.\n\nIf the process has to be forked, the platform MBean server is exposed on\na configurable port so that the maven plugin can connect to it.\n\nSuch change permits the maven plugin to integrate a classical integration\ntest scenario where the \"start\" goal is invoked during the\npre-integration phase and the \"stop\" goal during the post-integration\nphase.\n\nCloses gh-2525"}
