{"author_date": "2015-10-08 16:19:56+01:00", "msg": "Gracefully disable Solr auto-configuration when Solr 5 is on classpath\n\nPreviously, if Solr 5 was on the classpath, SolrAutoConfiguration\nwould fail with a rather cryptic error message due to a change in the\ninheritance hierarchy of CloudSolrServer between Solr 4 and Solr 5.\n\nThis commit updates SolrAutoConfiguration to be conditional on a\nclass that exists in Solr 4 but was removed in Solr 5. This has the\neffect of switching off the auto-configuration when Solr 5 is on\nthe classpath, allowing the auto-configuration report to be used to\nidentify why the configuration was disabled. The documentation has\nalso been updated to state that Spring Boot does not currently support\nSolr 5.0.\n\nCloses gh-2795"}
