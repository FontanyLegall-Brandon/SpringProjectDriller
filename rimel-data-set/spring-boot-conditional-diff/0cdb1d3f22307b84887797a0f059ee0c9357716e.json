{"author_date": "2014-10-30 13:29:27+00:00", "msg": "Make Spring Security's filter's order configurable and default to zero\n\nPreviously, Spring Security's filter had no configured order. Due to\nthe use of AnnotationAwareOrderComparater this meant that its order\ndefaulted to LOWEST_PRECEDENCE. This meant that a user had to declare\na FilterRegistrationBean for the filter and explicitly set its order\nif they want another filter to run after Spring Security's.\n\nThis commit updates the security auto-configuration to assign a\ndefault order of zero to Spring Security's filter, allowing filters\nto be easily configured to run before it or after it. This default\nvalue can overridden using the server.filter-order property. The\ndefault order is also exposed as a constant on SecurityProperties,\nallowing it to be referenced from other filter declarations.\n\nCloses gh-1640"}
