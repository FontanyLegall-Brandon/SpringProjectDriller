Having two\nseparate containers writing to the same file could cause problems such\nas causing log rotation to break.\n\nThis commit updates the actuator so that when the management server is\nrunning on a separate port (and therefore using a separate container)\nit prepends management_ to the access log prefix so that the main\nserver and the management server write their access logs to separate\nfiles in the same directory.\n\nCloses gh-6618"}
