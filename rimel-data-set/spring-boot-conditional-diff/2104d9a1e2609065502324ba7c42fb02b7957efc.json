It also asserts that\nthe current context (not including parents) contains such\na bean. This led to an inevitable failure when there was\nan existing instance in the parent context.\n\nFixed by a) searching only the current context, b) not\nadding a ServerProperties bean if the context is not a\nweb app."}
