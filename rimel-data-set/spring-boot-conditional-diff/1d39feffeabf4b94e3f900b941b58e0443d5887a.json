The primary goal is to introduce the concept\nof an `ExposableEndpoint` that has technology specific subclasses and\ncan carry additional data for filters to use. Many other changes have\nbeen made along the way including:\n\n* A new EndpointSupplier interface that allows cleaner separation of\n  supplying vs discovering endpoints. This allows cleaner class names\n  and allows for better auto-configuration since a user can choose to\n  provide their own supplier entirely.\n\n* A `DiscoveredEndpoint` interface that allows the `EndpointFilter`\n  to be greatly simplified. A filter now doesn't need to know about\n  discovery concerns unless absolutely necessary.\n\n* Improved naming and package structure. Many technology specific\n  concerns are now grouped in a better way. Related concerns are\n  co-located and concepts from one area no longer leakage into another.\n\n* Simplified `HandlerMapping` implementations. Many common concerns have\n  been pulled up helping to create simpler subclasses.\n\n* Simplified JMX adapters. Many of the intermediary `Info` classes have\n  been removed. The `DiscoveredJmxOperation` is now responsible for\n  mapping methods to operations.\n\n* A specific @`HealthEndpointCloudFoundryExtension` for Cloud Foundry.\n  The extension logic used to create a \"full\" health endpoint extension\n  has been made explicit.\n\nFixes gh-11428\nFixes gh-11581"}
